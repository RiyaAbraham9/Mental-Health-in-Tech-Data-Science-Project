# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Data-Science-Project
A data-driven analysis exploring mental health challenges within the technology industry. This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modelling, and visualization to uncover key insights and patterns affecting tech professionals' mental well-being.

## Project Motivation
Mental health in the tech industry is an increasingly important topic as workplace stress, burnout, and anxiety are prevalent among professionals. Understanding the factors influencing mental health can help organizations create supportive environments and encourage open conversations. This project aims to leverage data science to shed light on these challenges and promote awareness.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on publicly available dataset:
(Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey]
The dataset contains survey responses from tech employees on topics such as mental health status, treatment, workplace culture, and demographic information.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw survey data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations
- Visualize key metrics affecting mental health in the tech sector
- Build predictive models to classify or predict mental health status
- Extract actionable insights and recommendations for tech companies and employees

## Technologies and Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing demographic trends, treatment status, workplace factors, and mental health conditions.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new variables that may improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict mental health status.
5. Evaluation: Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. Visualization: Using charts and graphs to illustrate findings and support conclusions.
