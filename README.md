# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Data-Science-Project
A data-driven analysis exploring mental health challenges within the technology industry. This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modelling, and visualization to uncover key insights and patterns affecting tech professionals' mental well-being.

## Project Motivation
Mental health in the tech industry is an increasingly important topic as workplace stress, burnout, and anxiety are prevalent among professionals. Understanding the factors influencing mental health can help organizations create supportive environments and encourage open conversations. This project aims to leverage data science to shed light on these challenges and promote awareness.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on publicly available dataset:
(Mental Health in Tech Survey Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey]
The dataset contains survey responses from tech employees on topics such as mental health status, treatment, workplace culture, and demographic information.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw survey data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations
- Visualize key metrics affecting mental health in the tech sector
- Build predictive models to classify or predict mental health status
- Extract actionable insights and recommendations for tech companies and employees

## Technologies and Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing demographic trends, treatment status, workplace factors, and mental health conditions.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new variables that may improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict mental health status.
5. Evaluation: Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. Visualization: Using charts and graphs to illustrate findings and support conclusions.

## Key Findings

- **Gender and Mental Health Treatment**:
A higher percentage of female respondents reported receiving treatment overall.
Among men, those who work remotely are more likely to receive treatment (47%) than those who do not work remotely (44%).
Among women, those working remotely are also more likely to receive treatment (72%) compared to those not working remotely (67%).
This could suggest that remote work provides both men and women with more opportunities to prioritize their mental health, compared to those who work in-office. It also raises the question of whether in-office employees may experience more pressure or have less accessible support for mental health struggles.
The data shows that women are more likely to access mental health support whether they are remote or in-office, compared to men. This could suggest a need for more accessible, targeted support for men, both in the workplace and remotely. It also highlights the importance of addressing stigma around men's mental health and encouraging open conversations.

- **Age Distribution** :
Highest Treatment Rates:
Individuals aged 26–35 and 36–45 reported the highest rates of mental health treatment.
These age groups often face pressures related to careers, finances, and family, increasing stress and prompting them to seek treatment.
**Young Adults (18–25):**
May face access barriers such as cost, so it is less likely for them to access mental health help.
High stigma and fear of judgment may prevent them from reaching out, especially in academic or early workplace settings.
**Midlife Adults (26–45):**
Likely benefit from better access to healthcare through employment.
More likely to recognize symptoms and seek help due to past experiences or growing awareness.
**Older Adults (55+):**
May be impacted by generational stigma surrounding mental health.
Could also face digital access issues, reducing their ability to benefit from online therapy or remote care options.
This suggests:
  - Increase early support and de-stigmatization efforts for young adults.
  - Improve access and outreach for older adults, possibly through in-person and age-friendly services.
